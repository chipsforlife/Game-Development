                      This is a game development class based on Unity and Blender. In this class, I learned about 3D modeling, scripting, level design, animation, and sound design. I made a third-person shooter game where you must clear each and every level by shooting the enemies with you gun. Every few levels there will be a boss that you must defeat. I made my character model in blender to import into the game and use. I gave it some basic armor and animations. I exported my character model into a website that automatically animates your character for you.

                This is a 3D Game that I've been working on for a few months now. It's a third-person shooter game where you must shoot the enemies with your gun and move onto the next level. It's a package from the unity asset store called "3D Game Kit". I used this package for this class in order to use good quality maps and models. I replaced the character model with my own model from blender.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Programmed algorithms that calculated bullet trajectories, and enemy AI behavior, ensuring a seamless and combat experience.
            Programming the bullet trajectory in Unity involved implementing accurate physics calculations and incorporating factors such as velocity, gravity, and collision detection to create realistic and dynamic projectile movement.
            Integrated animations into the programming of bullet trajectory in Unity, synchronizing the firing animations with the projectile's launch and impact, enhancing the visual and immersive experience of the gameplay.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Through programming triggers in Unity, we implemented a system where specific events or conditions would activate behaviors in our game.
             By carefully defining these triggers and their corresponding actions, we were able to create dynamic responses such as enemy attacks, environmental interactions, or character abilities, adding depth and interactivity to the overall gameplay experience.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>When coding player movement in Unity, we employed input detection to capture user commands, and then used physics-based calculations to translate those inputs into smooth and responsive character motion.
             By applying forces or adjusting the player's position, we were able to create a dynamic and controllable movement system that allowed players to navigate the game world with precision and fluidity.

</h3>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>To enhance the player's shooting experience, we employed UI elements to create a crosshair that accurately represented the aiming position. By tracking mouse or controller input and dynamically updating the crosshair position on the screen, players were able to aim precisely at their targets. 
            Additionally, we incorporated a health UI element that visually displayed the player's remaining health, providing crucial feedback and immersing players in the intensity of combat as they monitored their well-being during gameplay.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>To simulate realistic enemy behavior, we programmed the Enemy AI to react to projectile hits by reducing its health based on the damage inflicted. 
Upon reaching a critical health threshold, a death animation would be triggered, visually indicating the enemy's defeat and adding a satisfying sense of accomplishment for the player.

          <h3 class="color-white">VI. Enemy AI Target Location</h3>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              In coding the enemy AI's target location for projectiles, we implemented algorithms that calculated the player's position and movement to accurately aim and predict their trajectory. 
Furthermore, we programmed the AI to react to the player's proximity, dynamically adjusting its behavior based on distance, such as initiating aggressive attacks or seeking cover. 
To bring the AI to life, we integrated locomotion by applying movement animations and pathfinding algorithms, allowing the enemies to navigate the game environment intelligently and pursue the player strategically.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              By utilizing the Unity Animator component, we were able to trigger animations through code, seamlessly synchronizing character actions and movements with the gameplay events. 
With the Animator's state machine and parameter system, we could dynamically change animation states, such as attacking, running, or idle, providing a visually cohesive and responsive experience for players.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              Using the Animation Window in Unity, we had the ability to edit and fine-tune animations, adjusting keyframes and transitions to achieve the desired look and feel.
 Additionally, we leveraged the power of the Animation Window to create trigger events, allowing us to synchronize specific animations with gameplay events, such as attacking, dodging, or interacting with objects.
 This powerful tool facilitated a seamless integration between animations and gameplay, enhancing the overall player experience.

            <p>
              By creating a debug level in Unity, we provided a controlled environment to thoroughly test player, enemy, and environment mechanics. 
This allowed us to iterate and fine-tune gameplay elements such as player movement, enemy AI behavior, and environmental interactions, ensuring a smooth and balanced experience.
 The debug level served as a valuable tool for troubleshooting, identifying bugs, and optimizing game mechanics, ultimately leading to a more polished and enjoyable game.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              To expedite the game level design process, we made use of free assets available in the Unity Asset Store. 
These assets provided us with a wide range of pre-made objects, textures, and environmental elements, saving valuable time and resources. 
By carefully selecting and integrating these assets into our game, we were able to create visually appealing and cohesive game levels, while focusing our efforts on customizing and fine-tuning gameplay mechanics to deliver an immersive and engaging experience.
